# Contributing

We'd love any and all contributors! WITWorld is a no-strings-attached side project we're maintaining for fun. So any kind of involvement - game mechanics suggestions, code contributions, etc. - is more than welcome.

We're more than happy to work with first time contributors. Check out the [Issues](https://github.com/tadasant/where-in-the-world/issues) and leave a comment if you see anything you'd be interested in tackling. We'll respond with more details/thoughts.

Otherwise, feel free to open up new Issues with requests or suggestions!

Other questions/thoughts can be sent to tadas [at] tadasant.com.
